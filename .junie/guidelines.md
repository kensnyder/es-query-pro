## Style / Code Layout

- Avoid placing `return` statements on the same line as preceding logic.
- Each statement should occupy its own line (no multi-statement single lines).
- Use explicit braces for `if`, `for`, `while`, etc., even for single-statement blocks.
- Avoid `any` and `as any` in TypeScript.
